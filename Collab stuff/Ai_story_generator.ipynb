            " caroline. i learned her name through the phonebook, my shaking fingers carefully caressing its pages as i searched for the address i'd seen her at so many times. 43 mako drive, the small, brick house on the corner of braxton and mako. i'd memorized the shape of her home weeks before, my bare feet sliding across its wet grass every time i closed my eyes. letters from her mailbox, addressed to caroline smith, confirmed what the book claimed. she was perfect, absolutely flawless in every way. i'd watched her for seven months almost every single day and night silently following her as she strolled to and from her classes. sometimes i stayed outside her bedroom window as we slept, my heart racing as i matched my breathing to hers. she never knew i was there, never acknowledged me as more than the distant shadow of a faceless tree, but i knew she needed me. she was all i could think about, all i wanted to be with. beautiful, flawless, ideal. if anything could convince me that angels truly visited this greasy, obscene, vile planet, then it would have been to see her. she was an artist, a creator she built perfect worlds that only she and i could appreciate, universes fit for the two of us. she taught her art at the community center next to the unsightly yellow pizza restaurant. i didn't understand why she bothered showing up. the students didn't respect her the other teachers didn't understand her no one truly valued her. they couldn't see her perfection, her talent, the unearthly skill she possessed. no one knew what she was worth except me. it was clear to me, everything she was capable of. the world wasn't able to comprehend what she could do only i, and the god above, could fathom such beauty. i knew i had to free her, to save her from the life of dismay and disrespect she endured. her perfection had to be known. she always walked alone, always spent her days and nights with a just paintbrush and canvas. the mail at 43 mako drive was never addressed to anyone but caroline, my fingers becoming accustomed to the rub of the ink stained c of her name pressed into her envelopes. she had no one but her art, nothing but the worlds she created in the comfort of her home as i silently watched under the shroud of the long set sun. she had me, had my support and devotion, my undying love and admiration, yet i knew that wasn't enough for her. she needed more, needed the embrace of the planet as they all screamed her name in singularity, hung her portraits in galleries and travelled halfway around the world to admire her brush strokes. she needed fame and fortune, acclaim and respect, followers and immorality. i knew i could give that to her, make her name a commodity and brand us as a single entity in the history of humanity. i wanted to be the one to launch her fame, the name that always followed her around. i wanted to be the reason she went missing, the person to force her into the world. i needed to free her from this filthy planet, be the one to release her soul to the millions scattered throughout the corners of the uncivilized, obscene earth. i knew she could inspire the masses and provoke the future. i left her alone one night, let her sleep without the comfort of my warm carcass nestled just feet away. i had to, i needed to prepare. it was soon to be our time, the moment we'd forever become names tied together in the media, in the voices of the people, in the pages of history and the world alike. i wanted to perfect where i'd take her, where i'd free her soul into immortality. i needed it to be flawless enough to display her art to the world. i prepped and painted, cleaned and set forth the tools to extract her my memory became blurred and uncertain as i toiled endlessly. it needed to be just as perfect as she. by the time i was content, my eyes had become bloody through lack of sleep, and the sun had long since risen. she was not in her room as my bare feet touched the familiar grass outside her window. i pulled open the unlocked back door, silently dragging my heels across the hardwood floor i'd felt so many times before. i'd once danced in that very spot, my feet softly tapping the ground not inches from where she slept i could hear her breathing in perfect synchronization as i spun. now her bed was empty, the window above it shattered and shimmering atop her sheets. her bureau lay sideways, its contents spilled out on the floor. i picked up the ruby shirt she wore to bed almost every night and held it to my face, the familiar scent of her perfume washing over me. i continued through her house. she valued her cleanliness, as did i. i'd watch as she spent hours, sometimes entire days, washing and organizing each and every inch of her home, always to perfection. now it was a mess, a chaotic wreck of turmoil and struggle. she'd never done this to me before, never forced me to see her in such a shape of sheer humanity. her walls, once rife with the beauty and life she painted, now lay bare, the art scattered and broken upon the floor. i clenched my teeth as i righted them, muscles tensing as i tried to hang them back in their correct places, but they were simply not the same. she had let someone else touch them they had lost their perfection. i allowed them fall back to the floor as i continued up her stairs. the creme carpet outside her studio door was stained a ruby red, still moist under the weight of my bare feet. i could hear her breathing heavily behind it, her gasps raspy and strained as if under a tremendous weight. i wrapped my hand around the doorknob, twisting the cold brass knob and silently pushing it open. i had to blink as i peered in, the vulgarity she exposed me to almost unbearable. the room was in disarray paintings torn apart, brushes scattered across the floor, shelves toppled over sideways. the worlds she'd created for just the two of us, the universes that were supposed to inspire the future, were now stained, covered in blood and paint and split by knife. the hope she'd given the planet lay destroyed in the middle of the room by her broken body. she couldn't even save her own self. she glanced up at me, her eyes studying me with a faint hint of recognition and dread, her mouth gagged and broken. i could hear her whimper softly, just as she occasionally did in her sleep as i stood watch. spilled paints surrounded her and mixed into a single, grotesque shade red, blues, yellows, whites, and every other color she'd previously had organized on the shelves beside the door. i stared at her for a moment, waiting for an apology as my eyes searched for the perfection and hope i'd seen for so long. she had been flawless, the only thing that could save the world from the pornographic, filthy wreck it had become. now, as she lay on the ground, her eyes screaming for my help, all i could see was failure and dependence. a mirrored figure shifted in the far corner of the room, its back to me. i glanced up at it and slowly shook my head. she was no more perfect than the rest. i turned around and quietly shut the door, then began back down the path i'd become so familiar traveling. alternate

            "Retrieved:  it was evening rush hour, and the interstate was clogged worse than a yeti's bathtub. j. robert harris sat in driver's seat of his mercedes and alternately debated the merits of upgrading to this year's model of the car, or just chucking it all in and going to live in a hut of a tropical beach and surviving off fish and coconuts. it is worth noting that robert harris did not particularly like the taste of fish or coconut. it amazed him that this many cars could fit on the highway. when you thought about it, the commute from his law office to his large house in the suburbs was only a few miles, and yet the highway seemed to stretch on interminably. find alternate routes, he ordered. the gps pinged back at him, and said. one alternate route found. it's faster. much, much faster. in fact you'd be an idiot not to take it, a complete moron ouch, there was a muffled thump and a pause, so in four hundred yards turn left. robert harris frowned. was the gps acting up? perhaps he should get that new merc sooner rather than later. and he could have sworn that the gps usually had a bland woman's voice with a regionless accent. just now it had sounded more like a child, high and squeaky. the new route popped up on the gps screen, and showed him turning off the highway into a field. cancel, robert said. stick with the original route. aw, c'mon, mister, the gps said. it did not change the route back. the car ahead, an old toyota with a bumper sticker that read stony pines elementary school , jerked forwards a few yards, as if the attendee of the school were the one at the wheel. robert eased up on the brake and let the merc coast gently forwards to close the space. it'll be worth it, the gps promised. it was definitely a kid's voice. robert frowned. had his children played some sort of joke on him? turn gps off, he ordered. the screen went black. the voice said, what'd you go and do that for? who the hell is this? robert demanded. ahead, a car tried to pull in between him and the toyota, and he honked angrily and then immediately felt bad about it and let the other car in. if you've hacked into my car, i'm going to sue your ass off. this is a gross breach of privacy. the traffic began to roll forwards. soup my ass? the voice squeaked indignantly. now 'old on, mister. ain't no call for that. get the hell out of here, robert said. he realized he was sweating uncomfortably. the gps's voice changed. it was a woman now, but not the normal one. this one was a low purr that made every surface of the car tingle with electricity. it was the sort of voice that actresses in certain types of films tried to achieve, but they never managed it like this. she said, turn left in fifty yards. robert glanced ahead. there was no left turning ahead, just the barrier at the side of the highway. no, he said, but he could sense the weakness in his voice. the traffic was picking up speed now. robert could see a small gap in the barrier, just ahead. in a few seconds he'd be past it. the voice whispered, it is time you discovered the truth. turn... left... now! his better judgment shoved into a corner of his brain by the intoxicating voice, robert spun the wheel. the merc darted across the next lane between a couple of suvs. horns blared. a corn field loomed ahead of him, beyond the gap in the barrier. just before his car went through the barrier, shock brought robert harris back to his senses. oh, shit, he said, and closed his eyes. there was a moment of weightlessness, a sickening crunch as the mercedes plunged into something large that definitely wasn't a cornfield, and the bang of an airbag. as the ringing in his ears subsided, a small squeaky voice said in his ear, i think he's dead. 'ere, you dead, mister? and a finger poked him in his very bruised, but definitely alive, ribs. part 2 below...\n"

Adi just got out of bed.A tiny, insistent buzzing vibrated against his cheek.He thought it was just his cheek muscles being tired from sleeping in a weird position.But the buzzing persisted, growing louder, a frantic, insistent hum that seemed to burrow into his very skull.It felt like it was not coming from the outside of his cheek, but rather from the inside.He cautiously touched his cheek, his fingers encountering a small, metallic object embedded just beneath the surface of his skin.Suddenly he realised, he's no longer himself. He was a robot.Panic, cold and sharp, sliced through the manufactured calm of his robotic mind.He runs to the bathroom, looking for a mirror, trying to see what sort of monstrosity he had become.His reflection stared back, not the familiar face he expected, but a polished chrome skull, gleaming under the harsh bathroom light, its surface subtly marred by a faint, buzzing tremor.He starts running in panic.His chrome feet slipped on the wet tiles, the metallic shriek echoing the frantic drumming in his artificial heart.And then suddenly he woke up, his phone buzzing against his cheek after he fell asleep talking on his phone. \\\"Honey,\\\" she whispered, her voice raspy with sleep, \\\"are you having a nightmare?\\\"He sees her and all the panic quickly leaves his body, a smile forming on his face.The smile faltered, replaced by a horrified grimace as he saw the chrome glint of his own hand reflected in her wide, tear-filled eyes.THE END.Then everything went black.\")\n",

            "Snippet: this story begins not once upon a time on the contrary, it takes place at a specific time, in a specific place, and features two very specific people. in reference to the cosmic calendar, wherein hundreds of years are compressed into the space of a single grain of sand, a day is the most arbitrary of measures. a raindrop in an ocean. however, for this story atleast, a day had all the meaning of a thousand years. it was thursday, march 26th. this was important, you see, because it was to be marshall henry morrison's last day on the planet earth. amy dane had been hesitant to go to that specific place, the greenwich federal prison, but in the end she decided that she must. for even though many years had passed since last she'd seen him, amy had never forgotten the little boy that grew up next door. so knives and forks clinked on ceramic plates as our two figures both tried to think of something to say to break the silence. the steak is a little dry, marshall said, it's better with the gravy. no, that's alright, amy said, thanks. marshall took a swallow of wine and looked down. he knew the circumstances of their reunion, but he'd wanted to make it as perfect as he possibly could. he was ashamed, deeply ashamed, that he couldn't even give her a decent meal. amy noticed his discomfort, but wasn't sure what she'd done to cause it. are they...treating you well, she asked. marshall shrugged, well enough, i suppose. tomorrow on the other hand.... amy blushed. i'm supposed to be helping him forget, instead i go about reminding him . the condemned man chuckled. i'm only kidding, he said, did they tell you my crime? amy met his eyes and found two spheres that held more pain and anguish than anything she'd ever seen. she couldn't help but look away, no, she lied. marshall leaned back, apparently relieved. well...you can ask. i'm sure it's what you've been wondering. it's really alright, i don't please, amy, marshall whispered. she looked at him. the little boy had become a man, his skin more tough, his eyes more hard, but inside he was still the same. he needs someone to hear his side , she realized. she nodded. okay. what happened? marshall's lips twirked up in the slightest of smirks, a ghost of the mischievous smile he's donned as a child. my luck ran out at the worst time possible, just like you always said it would. she laughed, but it was a soft laugh, and marshall perceived it as a laugh of pity. his smile faded away. you remember how you used to i remember, amy said, i just wish i'd been wrong. you never were, why start now? she smiled, i guess. go on. marshall took another sip of wine. you know how i used to save up all the money i earned delivering paper, and then together we'd go to the horse races and bet on the winners? amy laughed, how could i forget, you always had a good eye for it. we made more money than any kid should be able to have, and we'd blow it all on candy and ice cream, or fancy shoes, or anything else that caught our eye. that's just it, marshall said, i never really had a good eye for horses, i just figured out something that most people never do. what was that? marshall grinned, the races were fixed. so long as you could figure out which horse's victory would make the racing yard the most money, you could know who the winner would be. amy's gasped, you never told me! it would have ruined the experience for you, marshall said, you loved cheering for our horse, you wouldn't have cared to cheer if you knew it didn't matter. amy squinted, i suppose, she said, but what does this have to do with anything? as i grew older, marshall said, i discovered that there were many systems in place that operated the same way. i made a tidy profit gambling, did okay on the stock market, even dipped my hand in the entertainment business, but it was never enough...i needed something more, something grand . amy leaned forward. she unconsciously reached for her glass of wine, grasping at air several times before finally finding it. she took a long, slow sip. marshall sensed her attention, and it filled him with joy. this had been why it had to be her. war, he said. war? that's right. i don't get it. marshall chuckled. there a million things that can cause a war, a million strands of a web, a million pieces of a puzzle. but the fix is always in, the cost is too important for it to be otherwise. he paused for her to react, but when she said nothing he continued, the world keeps a careful eye on every civil war in every tiny nation, every border dispute, every revolution, and every conflict. if you can determine who will be the victor, you can collect a portion of the spoils. but how, amy asked, it's not as if there's a way to place a bet on border disputes. marshall shrugged, there are other ways to gamble. i provided loans to the side i knew would win, and charged mighty interest when their enemy fell. i sold weapons, i sold supplies, but most importantly, i sold intelligence. you'd be surprised what a nation at war would pay for a rumor, and even more surprised at the gratitude they'll show if that little piece of gossip helps lead to their eventual victory. amy's stomach felt sick, that's...marshall that's awful! it's war profiteering! i was a hero so long as my side won, marshall said, but i wouldn't be here if i'd only picked winners. so you backed a losing party? that's no crime. marshall laughed. i backed a monster, he said. i let the numbers blind me. i didn't pay attention to the details. the man said he wanted freedom for his people, and it looked like a winning cause. i provided weapons, intelligence, and more. i ate dinner with the revolutionary and his generals, i invited them into my home. and they did it. they won. but they didnt stop there. marshall looked green, like the words threatened to make him sick. when they finished defeating their enemy, they turned their guns to their enemy's widows, their children, their friends. they slaughtered countless innocents. the blood had drained from amy's face. she had nothing to say. i tried to cut ties as soon as i could, marshall said, i stopped supplying them, stop answering their calls. but it was too late. the world stepped in to intervene, and when they were finished, they found traces of all the support i'd provided over the years. now here i am, brought up on crimes against humanity. when he finished, he let the story sit for a while. amy felt tears welling up in her eyes. she'd wanted to hear that it was all a mistake, that the boy she knew could never have done the things he'd been accused of. yet, no matter how she looked at it, she knew he was guilty. still, she reached across the table and took his hand. tears were streaming down marshall's face, his entire body trembling. am i an evil man? no, amy said, you're not a good man either. you're just a man. but do i really deserve to die, marshall asked, his voice pleading. i... can't answer that, amy said. marshall shook his head. i know. i know you can't. but you can do something , can't you? you always knew what to do. amy wiped a tear from his eye. i'll tell you what i can do, she said. he looked up, hopeful. what? i can be there, she said, at the end. marshall studied her for a long while, she met his gaze with a solemn expression. finally, he nodded. she hugged him tight, if a tree falls in the woods, and no one is there to hear, does it make a sound? i don't know. neither do i. marshall's breath came heavy. he wept in her arms. when you fall, she said, i'll hear it. i'll remember the boy i grew up with. and at least one soul in attendance will know that you aren't evil, but only a man. r charlestonchews\n",
